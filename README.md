# DATA ANALYTICS/FINANCIAL AUDIT

I’ve seen the results of using various tools to improve the way we work and it sparked my desire to transition into
a data-focused role. In my auditing career, I often worked with large and messy datasets which required analytical
rigor and technical proficiency. With my limited knowledge back then, I often use Excel and Power BI to clean
datasets. Recognizing the growing demand for data-driven decision making, I’ve had the opportunity to develop
my skills in data visualization using Tableau & Power BI, data cleaning tools using SQL, and coding in Python to
further enhance my ability to analyze and communicate complex information effectively. With my new knowledge,
I’m excited to leverage these skills to contribute meaningfully in a data-focused role, helping organizations unlock
the value of their data to drive impactful decisions.

Having spent most of my career in the consumer product industry and being an avid consumer myself, I've always been interested in the way companies market their products/services and what goes into the whole thought process. By combining this experience with my expertise in data analytics, I can uncover hidden insights from complex datasets and translate them into strategies that enhance customer satisfaction, optimize marketing efforts, and boost overall profitability. I aim to bridge the gap between data and actionable consumer insights, helping companies make informed decisions that resonate with customers and drive growth.
